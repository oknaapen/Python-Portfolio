I took my first courses via the SoloLearn and Mimo apps.
These apps explain the basics of Python in a very simple and structured way. Through assignments linked to each topic, I learned how to apply the knowledge step by step.

Topics covered in the first courses included:

Writing code, Memory & Variables, Text Data, Numerical Data, Working with Variables, Debugging, Inputs and Outputs, Data Types, Working with Data, Comparison Operations, Logical Operations, Combining Comparison and Logical Operations, Control Flow, For Loops, While Loops, Conditional Statements, Lists, Indexing, Slicing, Functions, String Functions, List Functions, Custom Functions.
After completing two similar courses with this content, I initially decided to specialize in Pandas due to its relevance to data analysis. In this course, I learned about the extensive capabilities of Pandas and completed various exercises. Topics covered included filtering, data extraction, working with text data, multi-indexing, groupby operations, and data visualization.

For more details about how I apply these topics in practice, I kindly refer you to my exercises.

Following this course, I further enhanced my Python skills and obtained my Python Developer certificate. This certification covered advanced topics such as:

- Collection Types: Dictionaries, Dictionary Functions, Tuples, Tuple Unpacking, Sets, List Comprehensions.
- Functional Programming: Lambdas, map & filter, Generators, Decorators, Recursion, *args and **kwargs.
- Object-Oriented Programming: Classes, Inheritance, Magic Methods & Operator Overloading, Data Hiding, Class & Static Methods, Properties.
  In my bankaccount excersies I implemented the most of these topics. I would like to kindly refer you to that.https://github.com/oknaapen/Bankaccount,

- Exceptions Handling.
- Working with Files: Opening, Reading, Writing, and Managing files.

Curerntly I am doing a python bootcamp in addition to my current knowledge and skills.
I work on multiple exercises and projects in Python. The 100-day program covers a wide range of Python-related themes and topics. Angela Wu, a Python programmer and instructor, teaches the course through videos and examples, helping participants understand the programming language, import various libraries, and complete hands-on assignments. The course provides a comprehensive overview of Python and demonstrates how to use PyCharm in a user-friendly way.

While I have completed approximately 20% of the program, there are still many more exciting topics to explore. The assignments and projects are not only focused on Python basics but also introduce additional concepts, such as:

HTML, CSS, Web Design, SQLite, APIs, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, Data Science, GUI, Automation and more.
